Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
-The purpose of this project was to create a secure program/website for the company DriverPass that provides DriversEd to students remotely and rpovides instructors for in-person, behind-the-wheel training as well. DriverPass is looking to create a remote platform that allows their customers to access their course materials remotely while also allowing the employees and the owner to manage the business and materials in order to provide accurate and updated curriculum to their students.

What did you do particularly well?
-I feel that I addressed the functional and non-functional requirements well for this project. I wanted ot ensure that a wide spectrum of use cases were considered to ensure the platform was functional and reliable.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
-If possible I would revisit some of the charts I made. I struggled with the concepts/understanding some of the various diagrams and wasn't sure I used the correct syntax and organization at times despite my best efforts.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
-I made sure to take note of each of the user's requests and compared them to a list that I came up with when reviewing the purpose of the software. Addressing all use cases is critical in developing a usable program. DriverPass is a small company and does not have the resources to keep redesigning the program. Understanding requirements and requests from the jump ensures a smoother SDLC as well as a greater likelihood of customer satisfaction.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
-I am of the mindset of aim twice, shoot once. I placed a lot of emphasis on the planning and requirement collection for this project to ensure that when it came down to actually developing the programa nd making recommendations I wasn't having to go back and revise or adjust too much without sacrificing quality.
